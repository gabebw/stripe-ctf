# Run PHP file locally

* Install [PHP via homebrew](https://github.com/josegonzalez/homebrew-php) to
  get `php -S` functionality, bypassing Apache setup

Then:

    php -S localhost:8000
    http://localhost:8000/

# Add some debug statements

* Specifically, why doesn't passing in
  `?attempt=hello&filename=http://stripe-ctf.herokuapp.com/` work, since
  stripe-ctf just returns "hello"?

* Hmmm, works locally. I guess Stripe has stricter settings?


# Solution

Set attempt and filename to empty strings:

    https://level01-2.stripe-ctf.com/user-khzshmwvlj/?attempt=&filename=

Voila.
